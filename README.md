This is a small two-player browser game.
### Here is how it works:
Starting as player 1, you roll the dice by clicking the "ðŸŽ²Â ROLL DICE" button. Each time you roll the dice, the number will get added to the current score. You can keep rolling the dice until you roll a one. After that, the player will be switched. So if you want to hold the score you reached, you have to click the "ðŸ“¥Â HOLD" button; otherwise, your current score will be zero. Once you click the HOLD button, the current score will be added to the total score. And this game continues till one of the playerâ€™s total score reaches 100. The first player to reach 100 is the winner.

Hope you like it.
